chefconf-code-of-conduct
==========================

This is a "fork" of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct including the staff and 
attendee guides. 

Thank you to Adria Richards and many others with the Python Software 
Foundation and Python community for recommending that we publicly discuss 
and version control these documents so changes can be suggested, wording 
corrected and we can continue to iterate, as a community on these policies
and procedures.

\#ChefConf and the community as a whole are still very much in a learning 
process.  This is the second year of the conference and it is evolving 
daily. Each year we strive for massive improvements (such as the code of 
conduct and staff procedures) and \#ChefConf 2013 is no different.

We hope, as a team we can iterate and improve continually.

No changes are final until approved by the \#ChefConf Chair / Staff.
